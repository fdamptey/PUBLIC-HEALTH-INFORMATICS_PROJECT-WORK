#**Exploring Deep Learning AI Ultrasound as a Primary Breast Cancer Screening Tool**

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ By:

## Overview

This project investigates the use of deep learning, specifically **transfer learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, to classify breast ultrasound images into **normal, benign, and malignant** categories. Using a carefully preprocessed public dataset and models like **EfficientNetB0**, we aim to provide a **low-cost, highly accurate screening tool** that can be deployed especially in **resource-limited settings**.



## Objectives

- Fine-tune deep learning models for breast cancer classification.
- Evaluate model performance using clinically relevant metrics: **accuracy, AUC, sensitivity, and specificity**.
- Compare AI model performance against mammography AI and human readers from study findings.
- Evaluate feasibility of using **deep learning AI-powered ultrasound** as a **primary screening tool**, especially in LMICs (low- and middle-income countries).



## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset (BUSI)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset/data)

The dataset consists of **780 B-mode ultrasound images** divided into three classes:
- `normal`
- `benign`
- `malignant`

Ground truths were established through comparison with mammograms and confirmed by histopathology.


## Methods

### Preprocessing
- Resizing images to `224x224`
- RGB conversion for model compatibility
- Image normalization and augmentation
- K-Fold Cross-Validation (K=5)

### Models Used
All models were pretrained on ImageNet:
- EfficientNetB0 **(Best Performing Model)**
- ResNet50
- VGG16
- InceptionV3

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **AUC (Area Under Curve)**
- **Sensitivity**
- **Specificity**
- Confusion matrix and ROC curves

I maintained all hyperparameters for consistency across all models.

## üèÜ Results

| Model         | Accuracy | AUC   | Sensitivity | Specificity |
|---------------|----------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **EfficientNetB0** | **0.95**   | **0.99** | **0.933**     | **0.970**     |
| InceptionV3   | 0.941    | 0.982 | 0.934       | 0.962       |
| VGG16         | 0.933    | 0.982 | 0.909       | 0.951       |
| ResNet50      | 0.92     | 0.964 | 0.881       | 0.945       |



## ‚úÖ Conclusion

The EfficientNetB0 deep learning model achieved the **highest accuracy (95%)**, **sensitivity (93%)**, **specificity (97%)**, and **AUC (0.99)**, outperforming several other AI models, radiologist benchmarks, and many mammography-based systems. Ultrasound AI in general, showed comparable performance to mammography based system and surpassed human readers. 

This positions **AI-enhanced ultrasound** as a **promising primary screening tool** for breast cancer, especially in regions where **mammography access is limited**.



## Limitations

- Relatively small dataset size
- Limited hardware for extensive experimentation
- Time constraints affected the depth of literature review and retraining iterations



## Future Work

- Expand dataset diversity and size for better generalization
- Implement explainable AI (XAI) components
- Integrate segmentation and lesion localization
- Conduct meta-analytic performance benchmarking
- Validate models in clinical settings
